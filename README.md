Implementation of Basic Machine Learning Alogrithms using Python and scikit-learn library.

Tutorials refered are sentdex's Basic ML With Python - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v

Algorithms implemented are - linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, and neural networks.

For each major algorithm mentioned, we'll apply it in the code using real world data sets along with a module, such as with Scikit-Learn. 

Finally, the inner workings of each of the algorithm is explored by recreating them in code, from scratch, including all of the math involved.

This should give you a complete understanding of exactly how the algorithms work, how they can be tweaked, what are their advantages and disadvantages.
